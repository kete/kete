class ProfileSettings
  # ROB:  This class is here to remove settings stored in the acts_as_configurable 
  #       table.
  #       This would be per-object settings with targetable_type = "profile"
  #
  #       The original code has a comment that acts_as_configurable 
  #       "holds our profile's rule set".

    p "called profile instance #setting. You passed #{name}"
