# a method name is passed in that will be run during do_work method execution
# the method must be defined within the GenericMutedWorker class
# so you need to extend the class in your code so that your method can be called from do_work
# this should limit security risks
# if you need to send arguments to your custom method, pass an options hash
# this generic work isn't expected to report back to a web ui the state of progress
# thus it is called "Muted"
