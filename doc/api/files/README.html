      <h2>Welcome to Rails</h2>
<p>
Rails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes
everything needed to create database-backed web-applications according to
the Model-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view
(also called the presentation) into &quot;dumb&quot; templates that are
primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags.
The model contains the &quot;smart&quot; domain objects (such as Account,
Product, Person, Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to
persist themselves to a database. The controller handles the incoming
requests (such as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by
manipulating the model and directing data to the view.
</p>
<p>
In Rails, the model is handled by what&#8216;s called an object-relational
mapping layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the
data from database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with
business logic methods. You can read more about Active Record in <a
href="vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html">files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two
layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence.
This is unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack
that is much more separate. Each of these packages can be used
independently outside of Rails. You can read more about Action Pack in <a
href="vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html">files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html</a>.
</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start the web server: <tt>ruby script/server</tt> (run with &#8212;help for
options)

</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>/ and get
&quot;Welcome aboard: You’re riding the Rails!&quot;

</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines to start developing your application

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Web servers</h2>
<p>
Rails uses the built-in web server in Ruby called WEBrick by default, so
you don&#8216;t have to install or configure anything to play around.
</p>
<p>
If you have lighttpd installed, though, it&#8216;ll be used instead when
running script/server. It&#8216;s considerably faster than WEBrick and
suited for production use, but requires additional installation and
currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged to
start with WEBrick). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can
download it from <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net">www.lighttpd.net</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you want something that&#8216;s halfway between WEBrick and lighttpd, we
heartily recommend Mongrel. It&#8216;s a Ruby-based web server with a
C-component (so it requires compilation) that also works very well with
Windows. See more at <a
href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org">mongrel.rubyforge.org</a>/.
</p>
<p>
But of course its also possible to run Rails with the premiere open source
web server Apache. To get decent performance, though, you&#8216;ll need to
install FastCGI. For Apache 1.3, you want to use mod_fastcgi. For Apache
2.0+, you want to use mod_fcgid.
</p>
<p>
See <a
href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI">wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI</a>
for more information on FastCGI.
</p>
<h2>Example for Apache conf</h2>
<pre>
  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName rails
    DocumentRoot /path/application/public/
    ErrorLog /path/application/log/server.log

    &lt;Directory /path/application/public/&gt;
      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride all
      Allow from all
      Order allow,deny
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: Be sure that CGIs can be executed in that directory as well. So
ExecCGI should be on and &quot;.cgi&quot; should respond. All requests from
127.0.0.1 go through CGI, so no Apache restart is necessary for changes.
All other requests go through FCGI (or mod_ruby), which requires a restart
to show changes.
</p>
<h2>Debugging Rails</h2>
<p>
Have &quot;tail -f&quot; commands running on both the server.log,
production.log, and test.log files. Rails will automatically display
debugging and runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also
be shown in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.
</p>
<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Breakpoint.html">Breakpoint</a> support is available
through the script/breakpointer client. This means that you can break out
of execution at any point in the code, investigate and change the model,
AND then resume execution! Example:
</p>
<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def index
      @posts = Post.find_all
      breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present
you with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things
like:
</p>
<p>
Executing breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot; at
&#8230;/webrick_server.rb:16 in &#8216;breakpoint&#8216;
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; @posts.inspect
  =&gt; &quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;1\&quot;}&gt;,
       #&lt;Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Rails you know!\&quot;, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Only ten..\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;2\&quot;}&gt;]&quot;
  &gt;&gt; @posts.first.title = &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects
actually work:
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; f = @posts.first
  =&gt; #&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;
  &gt;&gt; f.
  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)
</pre>
<p>
Finally, when you&#8216;re ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D
</p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>
You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through
script/console. Here you&#8216;ll have all parts of the application
configured, just like it is when the application is running. You can
inspect domain models, change values, and save to the database. Starting
the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.
Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like
<tt>script/console production</tt>.
</p>
<p>
To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
<tt>reload!</tt>
</p>
