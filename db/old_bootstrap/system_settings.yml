  explanation: "When creating the different versions of uploaded images, such as thumbnails, should we keep the embedded metadata with the new version of the image? Not transferring embedded metadata to the new versions can make them significantly smaller, especially if the original has an embedded thumbnail version already. On the other hand embedded metadata may contain information that is important to keep, such as copyright holder."

  explanation: "By default, Kete will add a Dublin Core Date element with the date that the item was created on the Kete site to the item's search record. This is not always appropriate for all sites. For example, site's that have imported a lot of archival material may find this data unimportant and distracting from real date data in archival record item. Change this value to \"false\" to stop Kete from automatically adding the item's creation date to search records."

  name: Allowed Anonymous Actions
  technically_advanced: true
  required_to_be_configured: false
  explanation: |-
    What actions on the site will you allow people to do as a non-registered user. They will still be required to submit an email address and user name, but no permanent account will be created for them.

    Each action that you want to allow, must be in following format where the allowed_for is the first page (say a comment form) of the action you allow and the finished_after is the second URL that the allowed_for form submits to: { :allowed_for => 'controller_name/action_name', :finished_after => 'controller_name/action_name' }. An anonymous action description should then be wrappe in square brackets []. A setting with a single anonymous action for allowing anoymous comments (i.e. discussion) would have this value:

    [{ :allowed_for => 'comments/new', :finished_after => 'comments/create' }]

    You can multiple actions, in which case their declarations should be comma separated, like so:

    [{ :allowed_for => 'comments/new', :finished_after => 'comments/create' }, { :allowed_for => 'baskets/contact', :finished_after => 'baskets/send_email' }]

    At this time, these two actions (comments and contact form) are the only two actions we recommend. If you want to do more, you should discuss it on http://kete.net.nz.

    IMPORTANT: this HAS to be in correct format. Be very careful using this.
