    </ul>
    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>To register you need to select <strong>Register</strong> from the top right hand corner menu of Kete. You should read the <a href="/about/topics/show/4">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a href="/about/topics/show/5">Privacy Policy</a> before you register.</p>
    <p>Once you start the registration process by clicking on <strong>Register</strong> you will need to work fairly steadily to enter the required information. If you find you have troubles with the security code at the end it is because it expired while you were filling out the information; no problem - but you will have to start again!</p>
    <p>You will need to enter the following information:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Login</strong>: this is your private login name and will not be seen by other Kete users. It must be unique and we will check that it is available for use and let you know if it is isn't. It must not contain any spaces or punctuation, and is case sensitive so be careful about capitals and lower case letters. Choose something you will remember easily.<br /><em>If your name is John Smith your login might be 'jsmith17'.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> enter your email address. We will send you a confirmation email message when you have registered.</li>
    <li><strong>Password</strong>: choose a secret password that only you know or could guess easily. A good password would be 6 - 8 characters long and include a mixture of letters and numbers. We can not see your password so you might want to write it down somewhere safe, or maybe just a hint to help you remember it.</li>
    <li><strong>User name</strong>: This is screen name that other users will know you by. It could be your real name, especially if you want people to be able to find you, but it could also be a nickname. It can contain spaces and capitals.<br /><em>If your name is John Smith you might select 'John Smith' as your user name or you might prefer 'Captain Courageous'.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Email visible?</strong> You will be asked whether you want other Kete users to be able to see your email address. This can be helpful if you are interested in the same Kete subject areas, or if they are interested in some of the material you have added to kete. It is set to no by default.</li>
    <li><strong>Interests</strong>: You may like to list your interests or research areas for other Kete users. This is optional, but will be particularly helpful for genealogists and researchers.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Code</strong>: You will need to type in the security code that is shown in a greyed out box. This is case sensitive so capitals and lower case are important. This lets us know you are a person and not a potentially destructive, automated process. It changes after a short time period so you need be quite fast filling out your form. If you have taken too long and the security code check fails, then you need start again.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will need to acknowledge that you have read and accept to abide by the <a href="/about/topics/show/4">Terms and Conditions</a>, <a href="/about/topics/show/5">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/about/topics/show/2">House Rules</a> by clicking on the small check box to the left.</p>
    <p>Once you are registered you will be able to participate fully in every aspect of the Kete website.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This Kete is a community built digital library of arts, cultural and heritage resources for and about Horowhenua, New Zealand.</p>
    <p>The Site is about sharing content and therefore we have adopted the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">Creative Commons Licence</a> to govern how material is used on the Kete site. You should read the <a href="/about/topics/show/4">Kete Terms and Conditions</a> for further detail.</p>
    <p>The Kete library contains items:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Audio recordings</li>
    <li>Video recordings</li>
    <li>Documents</li>
    <li>URLs of web resources</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Topics (articles on a subject, person, place, event or thing)</li>
    <li>Discussion or comments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Topics are like collaboratively written encyclopedia articles. They are written online by anyone at all, and can be edited by other Kete users. <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a> is a good example of collaboratively written material.</p>
    <p>All Topics and Items can be 'flagged' to the attention of the Kete administrators if, you think it contains inappropriate material.</p>
    <p>Eventually a search of this Kete will also draw results from these Library Trust resources as well:</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.library.org.nz/">Horowhenua Library Trust catalogue</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.library.org.nz/resources/cemetery/">Horowhenua Cemeteries Database</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://community.library.org.nz/search.html">Horowhenua Community Directory</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the interim though, you will need to search these databases individually by clicking on the links above.</p>
    <p>There are many ways to use this Kete:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Search or browse the collection</li>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>There are a number of different ways to find material in this kete database. You can find things by discovery, or you can search for specific material.</p>
    <p>The homepage provides these ways to discover material:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>browse</li>
    <li>featured topics</li>
    <li>contents by type</li>
    <li>slideshow</li>
    <li>latest 5 topics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also find material by</p>
    <ul>
    <li>keyword search</li>
    <li>following hyperlinks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hyperlinks are bits of highlighted and underlined text, or they could be an image that cause the cursor to change to a hand when you move your cursor over it. Every page will have a number of hyperlinks and they are the way to move around this kete database.</p>
    <h3>Browse</h3>
    <p>By clicking on the browse button from the menu in the top right hand corner of the screen, you can see the entire contents of the database, with each item type displaying on a seperate tab. To view images only, click on the second tab , video clips on the 4th tab etc.</p>
    <p>You can vary how many records display per page by clicking on 5, 10, 20 or 50 records per page, from the menu at the bottom right of the screen. This makes it a pretty quick task to scan a few hundred items in a few minutes.</p>
    <p>Browsing is a really easy way to track of new additions to the database; the lists are sorted with the newest or edited ones displaying first.</p>
    <h3>Featured Topics</h3>
    <p>These are a selection of topics selected as being of particular interest. They might be new, or interesting, or demonstrate a really exciting use of the Kete Text editor (more on this later!). You can view the featured topic by clicking on the image or the title. Once you are at the topic page you can dig deeper by clicking on any of the links on the page.</p>
    <h3>Contents by Type</h3>
    <p>The contents of the Kete database are listed here, sorted by item type. It is just another way of browsing really, just showing on the homepage. Just click on an item type link.</p>
    <h3>Slideshow</h3>
    <p>The sidebar has a continuous slideshow of random images from the database. They change every 20 seconds but if one catches your eye you can click on the image to go to the detailed screen. You can advance through to the next image by clicking on next.</p>
    <h3>Latest 5 Topics</h3>
    <p>The newest 5 topics to be added to the Kete database display on the bottom left portion of the homepage. Jusxt click on the hotlinked title to go to the full record.</p>
    <h3>Keyword Searching</h3>
    <p>Kete is searched by typing a few words in the keyword search box; 1 - 3 words are usually enough. To the search the whole database make sure you do this from the homepage search box, or after clicking o the search link from the top right menu.</p>
    <p>You can <strong>truncate</strong> a word if you are not of the spelling or want to include variants on a word; for instance you could enter 'peters' if you are now sure whether a name is spelt 'Petersen' or 'Peterson'.</p>
    <p>Kete will accept simple <strong>boolean operators</strong>. This means you can search on a phrase if you place it between quote marks. For example a search on&nbsp; 'Horowhenua College' will only produce results that contain those 2 words together in a phrase, and leave out all the records containing both of these words but not sitting beside each other eg &auml; Topic containing: 'Waiopehu is a college in Horowhenua'. You can also use <strong>and</strong> and <strong>or</strong> and <strong>not</strong> to join phrases together.</p>
    <p>Kete uses fuzzy searching. This means that if you misspell a word it will try and find something close. For instance a search on 'polo' will also bring up results for 'pole' because we only had 1 result for 'polo' and you may have meant 'pole'.</p>
    <h3>View Search Results</h3>
    <p>Search results are sorted by item or file type, with each item type on its own 'tab'. Tabs in kete work like tabbed divider pages in a ringbinder, separating items into different catageories</p>
    <ul>
    <li>images or photographs</li>
    <li>audio clips</li>
    <li>video clips</li>
    <li>weblinks or urls</li>
    <li>documents</li>
    <li>discussion comments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To view the results, click on the tab of the item type you want to look at. The number on the tab shows how many records there are of each type.</p>
    <p>Each item type will display a list of results which matched your search terms. To view a particular record, click on anything which is a hyperlink. Clicking on a hyperlink will take you to the full record of the particular item.</p>
    <p>By default, the search results display 5 records per page. To view the next 'page' click on the <strong>next</strong> link on the right hand side of the screen (about 1/2 way down). You can also use the <strong>previous</strong> link to move backwards and forwards.</p>
    <p>You can change the number of records that display per page by selecting a 10, 20 or 50 from the menu at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><strong>Items</strong> are individual records in Kete. They can be a variety of different types: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Audio recordings</li>
    <li>Video recordings</li>
    <li>Documents</li>
    <li>Web links</li>
    <li>Discussion</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Topics</strong> are the way to gather items together into subject clusters of related material, regardless of item type.</p>
    <h3>Add a New Topic</h3>
    <p>Topics are gathering points for drawing clusters of items together and a way to capture and craft the collective knowledge of our community.</p>
    <p>A Topic is like an encyclopedia article; it can be anything from a few sentences to a few pages long. The difference is, that Kete Topics are built collaboratively by the Kete community. One person might write the Topic, but other people can add to and edit the Topic. <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> is a good example of collectively written articles.</p>
    <p>If you would like to know if someone changes a Topic you have written you can subscribe for an RSS feed.</p>
    <p>Topics are used to gather together related items. An item may be linked to from one topic, many topics or none at all. In the early days of Kete there will be many thousands of items and very few topics. We need people to write topics and then link them to related images, documents, web links, audio and video items.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>Add a new Topic</strong> from the bottom of the search result  or browse page.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose a topic type</strong> first. A range of Topic templates have been built based on different sorts of topics. These are arranged in a heirachy from the most general to more specific. After the highest level topic, there are 5 parent topics, and a number of subtopics attached to these. Subtopics inherit the fields of their parent topic.</p>
    <table border="0" width="625" height="396">

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Once you have selected a topic and clicked on the choose button, a from will appear for you to fill in. Most fields are optional, with only the first 2 being compulsory:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Title</strong> : A few words.</li>
    <li><strong>Short summary</strong>: a sentence summarising or introducing the topic.</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong>: this field can be as long as you like and is the body of the topic. You can use the Kete Text Editor tools to format your text if you like, with bolding, highlighting or italics. You can insert tables, weblinks or images</li>
    <li><strong>Tags</strong> : Tags are keywords which are used to search Kete. You don't need to enter words already used in the title, summary or description. Enter as many as you like, separated by a comma. Think about who the people are, what the subject matter is, what the items or objects or places are. When was the photo taken? The more tags you enter here the more chance we have of other people finding it! This field is optional</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some templates contain many fields eg. People - genealogy. Just fill out as many fields as you have information for. When you have finished select <strong>Create</strong> and the topic you have just created will display on screen. You are now ready to add related items to this topic if you have some, or link to related items or related topics already in the database.</p>
    <h3>Link to a Related Existing Topic</h3>
    <p>Once you have written your Topic you can link it to existing Topics and Items, forming webs of related material. At the bottom of each Topic page, you will find <strong>+Link to related topic</strong></p>
    <p>Click on this and a pop up window will appear with a search box. Enter a keyword or two and a list of Topics that match your search will appear. Select them by clicking on the white box to the left. As each one is linked it will disappear from the list and be replaced with the message '<strong>Topic Linked Succesfully</strong>'. When you have finished close the window.</p>
    <p>If you are unsure whether a Topic is related or not you can go to the Topic detail page by clicking on the Topics title, and the Topic will open in a separate window. Close the window when you are finished by clicking the red cross in the top right corner.</p>
    <h3>Protecting your Topic From Changes</h3>
    <p>A primary aim of kete is that the database is collaboratively built. This means you can edit other people work and they can edit yours.</p>
    <p>Sometimes though, you may want your work to stay as you wrote it, and not be available for editing. To do this you can save it as a pdf and attach it as a document item. Just enter a summary into the description field, rather than the full text, and put lots of useful tags to help people find your work. You could also write a really brief Topic using the publication template and link it to your document, especially if your work comprises many pages. Put each section up as a separate document and link to them from the topic.</p>
    <p>If you intend to add a large amount of material to Kete, you could inquire about a Locked Basket by contacting the Site Administrator at the contact link on the homepage</p>
    <h3>Add a new Item</h3>
    <p>Adding any of the different Item type all happen with broadly the same process, although they each have slightly different onscreen forms to fill in:</p>
    <p>1. Select the item type you want to add:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Topic</li>
    <li>Documents</li>
    <li>Audio</li>
    <li>Weblinks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Go to the right tab, depending on your choice above, from either the search or browse screens. At the bottom of the screen you will find a link: <strong>Add a new Image</strong> (or audio or document etc). Click on it and a template will open for you to complete.</p>
    <p>Fill out the 3 fields:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Short Summary</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Browse to the file you want to upload, which must be prescanned and available . Any common file format can be loaded.</p>
    <p>4. Complete the optional fields if can.</p>
    <p>5. Click on the Create button.</p>
    <h4>Images</h4>
    <p>Images can be digital photographs, digital copies of photographs or digital photographs of objects or things. Any common file format can be used; jpegs for preference. Tiffs will work but they won't generate a thumbnail image in the search results. It is best not to load up large files; 200dpi is fine for internet&nbsp; display. Remember that many people have slow broadband or dialup connections.</p>
    <h4>Topic</h4>
    <p>Topics can be linked or related to other Topics. eg. father to son, or a Family to a sub division of their farm etc.</p>
    <h4>Weblinks</h4>
    <p>Sometimes the copyright statement of something you found on the internet forbids you from copying or saving the information. In this case you can add a weblink in Kete which will link back to the place on the internet. You will need to add the url of the web resource, instead of browsing for a file. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">url</a> is displayed in the address bar and usually starts with http://www. Instead of copying this long piece of information down you can copy and paste. Copy by right click on your mouse then selecting copy, or cntrl C. To paste it in either right click - paste or Cntrl V.</p>
    <p>The only problem with links is the internet changes all the time, and links which worked last month may not work next month. If you can legally copy the content off into a topic or description thats definitely the best way, but often you can't and a weblink will have to do.</p>
    <h4>Documents</h4>
    <p>You can attach most common file types as documents. We have found that compressed jpegs download much faster than normal jpegs. Remember that some people still have dial up connections so make your files smaller if possible.</p>
    <p>The documents can be a scan of the original document eg a letter or a page from a minute book. The contents of the document will not be searchable by Kete, but there are a couple of ways to help people find your document:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Title</strong>: Write a short, specific title.</li>
    <li><strong>Short summary</strong>: A few sentences summarising the contents of the document. This will display on the search results list.</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong>: This can be a complete transcript of the document if you wish, or someone else might do this for you.</li>
    <li><strong>Tags</strong>: enter lots of keywords.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to write your description first, please use a text editor, like Notepad, rather than Word or Word Pad. If you copy and paste from a Word document into the Description field lots of nasty formatting comes over which you can't see but which can cause havok with the display. Copying from Notepad works fine. You will find it on a Windows system under start, programmes, accessories. Don't do any formatting except paragraphs, because it will all be lost when you paste it into Kete - but you can format it in once you are there ie bold, underline, italics etc.</p>
    <p>Documents are a great way to manage large works. Scan each small section, as in a few pages, and add each section as a separate document. Big pdfs are awful to download. Gather them all together by linking them to a Publication topic.</p>
    <h4>Video</h4>
    <p>You need to save your video clip as a simgle file, not a folder with an audio and video file. We have successfully uploaded .mpg , .avi and .wmv  video.</p>
    <p>.swf should be supported, as should macromedia director files. We recommend Quicktime as the best current format.&nbsp; It's well developed and stable. Microsoft have tried many times to come up with a professional level video format and for various reasons they end up back at the drawing board, thus a large amount of earlier windows formats that Microsoft abandons support for after a while.</p>
    <h3>Add a related existing Item</h3>
    <p>Kete has been seeded with about 10,000 images from the collections of Foxton and Horowhenua Historical Societies, plus many hundreds of pages of typed material our volunteers have prepared. These can be linked to Topics.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of each Topic page, for each Item type, you will find <strong>+Link image</strong> (or documents, audio, video, web link).</p>
    <p>Click on this and a pop up window will appear with a search box. Enter a keyword and a list of Images that match your search will appear. Select them clicking on the white box to the left. As each one is linked it will disappear from the list and be replaced with the message '<strong>Image Linked Succesfully</strong>'. When you have finished close the window.</p>
    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>'Tags' or keywords are entered by the creator, and by anyone else who thinks other words should be included. Tags are hyperlinks so you can search for other items in Kete by clicking on a tag. Any variations of useful search terms can be added as a tag.</p>
    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>You may have something to say about a topic or item; maybe you think it contains errors but you are not sure, or you want to add an informal comment or recollection. You can add a comment to the discussion by clicking the <strong>Add a Comment</strong> hyperlink.</p>

    <p>All linking is done from a Topic; you can link to another Topic, or to any Item type.</p>
    <h3>Link a Topic to a Related Existing Topic</h3>
    <p>Once you have written your Topic you can link it to existing Topics and Items, forming webs of related material. At the bottom of each Topic page, you will find <strong>+Link to related topic</strong></p>
    <p>Click on this and a pop up window will appear with a search box. Enter a keyword or two and a list of Topics that match your search will appear. Select them by clicking on the white box to the left. As each one is linked it will disappear from the list and be replaced with the message '<strong>Topic Linked Succesfully</strong>'. When you have finished close the window.</p>
    <p>If you are unsure whether a Topic is related or not you can go to the Topic detail page by clicking on the Topics title, and the Topic will open in a separate window. Close the window when you are finished by clicking the red cross in the top right corner.</p>
    <h3>Link a Topic to Existing Items</h3>
    <p>Kete has been seeded with amany images, plus many hundreds of pages of typed material our volunteers have prepared. These can be linked to Topics.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of each Topic page, for each Item type, you will find <strong>+Link image</strong> (or documents, audio, video, web link).</p>
    <p>Click on this and a pop up window will appear with a search box. Enter a keyword and a list of Images that match your search will appear. Select them clicking on the white box to the left. As each one is linked it will disappear from the list and be replaced with the message '<strong>Image Linked Succesfully</strong>'. When you have finished close the window.</p>
    <h3>Creating Weblinks in Description Fields</h3>
    <p><strong>Tags:</strong> Tags are keywords that become weblinks once you save the Topic or Item you add them to. Enter as many different keywords or search terms as you think may be useful, and feel free to add them to other Items and Topics.</p>
    <p><strong>Text Editor</strong> : The description field when creating Topics and Items is very powerful, and includes the ability to make text or images weblinks to other Items or Topics. Select the text,. or click on the image that you want to be the weblink and then select the chain icon from the top row of the toolbar immediately above the description field. Enter the destination for the weblink into the url field and save. It's that easy!</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Locked baskets are fully searchable with a general Kete search, but a search can be limited to a specific basket. While locked baskets can be searched by anyone, the contents can only be edited by the basket owner and nominated members. </p>
    <h4>How do I get one?</h4>
    <p>Locked baskets are rare, and are given to organisations who intend to build large or unique collections within Kete. If you are interested in a Locked basket please contact the Site Administrator a the contact link on the homepage.</p>
    <h2>Set Up</h2>
    <p>Locked baskets are essentially mini-ketes and are configured by the basket administrator. Each locked basket has a homepage which is similar in structure to the main Kete. There are a number of components to be considered and configured:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Main portion</li>
    <li>Search</li>
    <li>Contents</li>
    <li>Slideshow</li>
    <li>Tagcloud</li>
    <li>Latest 5 topics</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Access the configuration tools</h3>
    <p>Following a successful application you will need to configure your Locked Basket. At the bottom of the main Kete homepage you will see a list of featured baskets. Click on your basket, and you will see 3 options appear: edit, members, delete. Select edit to configure your basket.</p>
    <h3>Edit</h3>
    <p>Selecting Edit will take you to the configuration page.</p>
    <h4>1. Edit basket</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Current homepage topic: <a href="/adopt_an_anzac/topics/show/41-adopt-an-anzac">Sample</a></li>
    <li><a href="/adopt_an_anzac/topics/new?index_for_basket=2">Add new basket homepage</a></li>
    <li><a href="/adopt_an_anzac/search/find_index?index_for_basket=2" onclick="window.open(this.href,'links','height=300,width=740,scrollbars=yes,top=100,left=100');return false;">Link to new basket homepage</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first configuration choice determines the <strong>Main portion</strong> of your basket's homepage. A current homepage topic will have been created for you in skeleton form. You will need to edit it by clicking on the link. It is edited like any other Topic in Kete.</p>
    <p>Later, you may want to create a replacement homepage topic over a couple of sessions, rather than editing the existing one. Click on a 'Add new' to do this, and when you have finished and are ready to make it your homepage topic click on 'Link to new' and enter the title of the replacement homepage Topic. Click on the box to the left of the new homepage topic to select it.</p>
    <h4>2. Basket Homepage Preferences</h4>
    <table border="0">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Redirect to results of</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Generally this would always be left on <strong>don't redirect</strong>. If you do not have a homepage topic then you can choose a default screen from the drop down box.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;" rowspan="2">Choose what should appear on the homepage topic</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">If you do not want the sidebar displaying then select <strong>Only Homepage Topic</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Otherwise, select which elements of the Topic page you want to display on your homepage: just the main portion or the main portion plus a link to whole page including the lower section. Play around with the options in the drop down box to see the different effects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;" rowspan="2">Recent topics</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">You can choose how many, if any, of the most recent topics will appear on your homepage; 5 looks good.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Decide whether you want to them to display as Headlines or Summaries</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Search</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Decide whether to include a basket search form or not. Selecting it is recommended as it allows a search to be made just on your basket, rather than the whole Kete database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Content in sidebar after search</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">There is an option to include a sentence or 2 on the sidebar, underneath the search box. Kept this short and snappy. You can format it using the text editor. A wee hint: the format box on the far left of the second row contains preset heading formatting that matches the rest of the site. You cannot insert forms or javascript.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Selected image</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">This can be selected to latest, random or no. Latest will dispaly the most recent iamge to be added to your basket, random will select a slideshow and no image is just that!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Archives</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">You can select to show the content sof your basket sorted by type. This is a good option to showcase the extent and variety of material in your basket.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">Tags</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid #000;">You can elect to display tags in categories or as a tag cloud on your sidebar. This is effective if you have tagged the items you have created with keyword search terms.&nbsp; There are a couple of display choices so have a play around with the various effects.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Members</h3>
    <p>You can give editorial access to select members of the main Kete site. These will be people who you are happy to add and edit items and topics in your Locked Basket. Everyone can view your basket but these members can make changes in it.</p>
    <h3>Delete</h3>
    <p>Do not click on this unless you want to delete your entire basket!</p>

    <h3>The Dream</h3>
    <p>I would love every community in New Zealand to have a Kete they can contribute theirs stories to. I would love these Kete to be part of a nationwide Kete.net system, whereby searchers can select which Kete to search on. Imagine if you knew your family hailed from the West Coast gold fields, but then farmed at Foxton, and how with one search you could select to run your search over Kete Kapiti and Kete West Coast, and the results would all appear in one list.</p>
    <p>This is possible with Kete, it is possible with New Zealand, and It is possible anywhere else in the world you cared to set up a Kete network.</p>
    <h3>What we have done so far</h3>
    <p>We have just about got this Kete where we want it; still a small handful of bugs to fix but all core functionality and proof of concept work is done now. We seriously underestimated our development budget for Kete (being a bunch of wildly optimistic Kiwi's) and have been finishing the product off with voluntary labour and no budget.</p>
    <p>The Library Trust has taken a huge financial hit getting Kete this far - because they love it - but we'll need help to get it out to the world.</p>
    <h3>What next</h3>
    <p>The next  step is getting the code ready to release - and for this we will have to pay the  developer!</p>
    <p>We propose to do the following:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>1. Build a release of the code (minus all the Horowhenua customizations) that can be downloaded, installed and configured using a web based wizard to step newbies through the process, thus allowing a unique Kete installation.</li>
    <li>2. Develop a prototype for skins or themes to allow a  customized installation reflecting an organisations culture or style.</li>
    <li>3.  Establishing a kete.net community site for developers and users.</li>
    <li>4. Pay a Kete.net coordinator to promote, advise, guide and develop the project.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How much</h3>
    <p>We need another $NZ 100k for the next round of development work. This will achieve 1-3 above. Then we need about $30k a year.</p>
    <p>We have an application in to our original funders, NZ National Digital Strategy : Community Partnership Fund, for a second chunk of cash to make Kete available for all who want it, and we should hear back late June. We have also applied to Te Paerangi National Services at Te Papa for some help.</p>
    <h3>How to help</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>You can make personal or institutional donations by credit card from anywhere using the Paypal donation onthe Kete homepage; even just $20 from many people will get us where we need to be.</li>
    <li>If you want a Kete for your community, no matter where you are in the world, then you may need to consider helping us out financially so we can get the code ready and a support community established.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Contacts</h3>
    <p>Jo Ransom from <a href="http://library.org.nz">Horowhenua Library Trust</a> about the project itself, and to use Kete. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; email: jransom@library.org.nz</p>

    <h3>The Administrator's Toolbox</h3>
    <p>Not surprisingly, the Adminstrator's Toolbox at the bottom of each page will appear if you are logged in as a site administrator.  Here you will find links to add or edit fields that may appear in forms of topics or content items (extended fields), manage users of the site (site members), and setting up the various topic types and content types to use the extended fields that you have.</p>
    <p>In addition, if you are also a technical administrator, you gain the ability to run imports or manage which search databases (Z39.50 search databases) are used. If your search records (browse/search results pages) get corrupted you may also "Rebuild search databases".</p>
    <p>The Administrator's Toolbox is where to start if you want to manage your entire Kete later.</p>
    <h3>Extended Fields, Topic Types, and Content Types</h3>
    <p>Your Kete will contain Items and Topics. All items and topics can have extended fields attached. For topics, it is possible to build a Topic Type template for shaping content by nominating various fields to be used for that topic.</p>
    <h4>Extended Fields</h4>
    <p>Fields are used in Kete by Topics and Item types. In Kete they are used for adding form fields for a topic or item. Fields can simply be text or more powerful through use of <a href="http://kete.net.nz/site/topics/show/236-how-can-i-configure-choices-or-categories-using-extended-fields">predefined choices</a> (including hierarchy) which can spawn searches, automatic linking of related topics, and even <a href="http://kete.net.nz/documentation/topics/show/233-configuring-google-maps-in-kete-12">show location on a map</a>. They also make the topic and item pages easier to scan for information.</p>
    <p><br />Kete has a very flexible approach to fields. Where as in a library context, the use of certain fields is governed by MARC standards, Kete fields can be whatever is deemed to be appropriate to the content of the Kete. All fields can be mapped to a simple Dublin Core Metadata Element. Kete supports the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. Once the fields are mapped to DC Elements, Kete uses the same standards as a compliant OAI PMH repository. This means that OAI PMH harvesters (such as google) will be able to make better use of the data in your repository. Kete can also be configured to provide a full blown <a href="http://kete.net.nz/documentation/topics/show/190-turning-on-ketes-oai-pmh-repository">OAI-PMH repository</a>.</p>
    <p>Nominating Kete fields is not something that needs to be done completely at set up. As the repository grows, it is expected that the administrator will add more fields as required to meet the needs of the data set. The catch is that if new fields are added to the repository once a significant amount of data is added, then older records will need to be updated.</p>
    <h4>Field parameters in Kete</h4>
    <p><strong>Label</strong><br />This is the field name. It is what will display to all users. <br />For items this will display under the item on the item page. For topics the fields are displayed (by default) to the right in the highlight box. <br />Examples: Creator, Place of Birth</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Description</strong><br />The description displays to the administrator only on the field edit screens. These need to be meaningful to administrators only as they are not seen by the public. As such it can be left blank but is useful for keeping notes about the field if the name or use is ambiguous.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>XML Element</strong><br />This is where references to Dublin Core Metadata Terms are stored. At present Kete will recognize and utilize only the simple set of DC terms. The fields are currently free text but the terms should be prefixed with dc:. Acceptable terms are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Title (this is automatically mapped to the title or name given for each item or topic)</li>
    <li>Creator - dc:creator</li>
    <li>Date - dc:date</li>
    <li>Subject - dc:subject</li>
    <li>Description - dc:description (this automatically mapped to the description text area for each item or topic)</li>
    <li>Publisher (mapped to your Kete name)</li>
    <li>Contributer dc:contributor (mapped to the Kete user)</li>
    <li>Type dc:type</li>
    <li>Format dc:format</li>
    <li>Identifier dc:identifier</li>
    <li>Source dc:source</li>
    <li>Language dc:language</li>
    <li>Relation dc:relation</li>
    <li>Coverage dc:coverage</li>
    <li>Rights dc:rights </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most commonly mapped elements in the Kete Horowhenua, for example, are dc:date, dc:subject and dc:coverage.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Ftype (Field Type)</strong><br />This is where you may say whether the field should be text or something more elaborate, like choices.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Import Synonym (Ignore)</strong><br />This is used for importing data sets into Kete from Past Perfect or XML files. The import synonym is the column name in the file that matches with the Kete field.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Example</strong><br />This is used to help shape the data in free text fields. The administrator can suggest the format the data can be saved in. This is suggestion is displayed in italics below the field label.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Multiple</strong><br />Currently when 'multiple' is selected, instead of one text field being available for data entry, the user is presented with multiple input fields. The administrator can define how many multiple fields are displayed as part of the site settings.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Base URL:</strong><br />If relevant to your ftype, this base URL will be used to create a link in the display of extended field where the entered value is added at the end of the Base URL.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Available Choices:</strong><br />If relevant to your ftype, you may choose which choices (defined in Administrator's Toolbox > choices for extended fields) this field should use.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Topic Type Choices:</strong><br />If relevant to your ftype, you may choose which topic type users will be able to choose from for their value.</p>
    <h4>Level of Detail Required</h4>
    <p>At this stage a full and definitive set of fields is not required. Fields can be added at any time. However it does make it easier later on if the fields are thought through at this stage. Particularly fields that will be used by multiple topics and items.</p>
    <p><br />Working on fields can not be done in isolation from determining initial Topic Templates and Item Types. The initial Topic Templates you decide to build will influence the fields you require. Our advice is to think carefully about the fields you will nominate. To few, and the data will not be useful, too many and it will be onerous and clumsy to add new information to your Kete.</p>
    <h4>Topics</h4>
    <p><strong>Summary </strong><br />Topics are used to link items together. They provide the user browsing a Kete with the background information as to why various and seemingly, unrelated items, are in fact related. Topics can also be linked to other topics.</p>
    <p><br />The minimum set of data that can be stored against a topic is a Title, a Short Summary (used in search results) and the Description. To enable further content shaping, topic templates can be created where fields can be associated to a topic. These templates can be built into a hierarchy, where each child template, inherits the fields form it's parent template, and extends with it's own fields.</p>
    <p>Topics are not essential for a Kete to work. A Kete can have just items. The purpose of topics is to make it easier for other users to find content within Kete. <br /></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>The Site Basket</h3> <p>Homepage options apply to both the homepage of the Kete (ie the root) and basket homepages. All can be configured to a have different layouts.</p>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>This will be used in all links and to create the link to the basket homepage <br />e.g Title Adopt An Anzac, URL http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/adopt_an_anzac</p>
    <h4>Home page Redirect</h4>
    <p>Instead of a homepage, the basket URL can be redirected to other content in Kete. <br />The options are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>No Redirect (default - this will create a homepage using the homepage options)</li>
    <li>Search results for this basket of </li>
    <ul>
    <li>All topics</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All images</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All audio</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All video</li>
    </ul>
    <li>All documents</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All web links</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>All discussion</li>
    </ul>
    <li>No Redirect Options</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If No Redirect is chosen there are two more options for what is displayed on the homepage</p>
    <p><br />Either</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The homepage topic only or;</li>
    <li>The homepage topic, full details (extended fields) and comments</li>
    <li>The homepage topic, and full details (extended fields)</li>
    <li>The homepage topic, and comments</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Recent Topics Options</h4>
    <p>The basket home page can be configured to included different types of displays for topics recently added to the basket.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Number of Recent Topics to display</strong><br />This is a free text integer. Recommended values are 3, 5 and 7.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Display options</strong><br />There are 3 display options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't display recent topics (default)</li>
    <li>Summaries (blog style). Displays Title and Short Summary for topic. </li>
    <li>Headlines (news style). Displays Title and Description (main body content) for topic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Side bar Options</h4>
    <p>The next set of options are all for configuring the sidebar. The sidebar position, size and style are controlled by CSS. This interface does not allow the editing of these parameters, only what displays in the side bar. The order of these elements can not be changed and the order they are displayed is as per the order here.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Search</strong><br />Checking this box will include a search box for this basket in the side bar. This search is restricted to the contents of the basket only. Items within a basket will show up on a standard Kete search, but from this interface, only topics and items within this basket will be returned.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Content in Sidebar </strong><br />Any content entered into the HTML editor will be displayed in the side bar for the home page. This can include images, tables and links. However javascript or forms can note be embedded.To enter no content, leave the editor blank. </p>
    <p><strong>Selected Image</strong><br />Displays a thumbnail image from the basket. Clicking on the thumbnail links to the image details. <br />There are 3 options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>No image (default)</li>
    <li>Latest </li>
    <li>Random. If random is selected, this will generate a slide show of images from the basket. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Archives</strong><br />Two options</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't display (default)</li>
    <li>By type. This provides a link to the search results for each Item type and gives a count of the number of items in the search results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Topics (1,200)</li>
    <li> Images (10,839)</li>
    <li> Audio (66)</li>
    <li> Videos (8)</li>
    <li> Web Links (88)</li>
    <li> Documents (652)</li>
    <li> Discussion (10)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tags</strong><br />This displays tags used within the basket. The tags are links to search results of items that use those tags. There are several sub options.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Number of Tags</strong><br />This sets the number of tags to be displayed and is a free text integer.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Tag Display</strong><br />Two options:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>As categories - in a list form </li>
    <li>As a tag cloud - where size and boldness of text indicates size of collection<br /></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are a number of other options for baskets that are not yet covered in this topic. Again, check <a href="http://kete.net.nz/">Kete.net.nz</a> for further information.</p>
