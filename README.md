# Kete 2.0 work in progress

This branch is a partially complete modernisation of the Kete codebase 

* upgrade to Rails 3
* move dependencies to gems that are currently being maintained.

This work is not yet complete so this branch is not ready for production use.
You can view existing content in the Kete but creating or editing content is not
working yet.

Take a look at kete2.herokuapp.com for a demo of the application
