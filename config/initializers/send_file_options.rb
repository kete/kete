# Kete can store and retrieve private files, which are kept in a separate folder called 'private'
# under the application root directly (i.e. /home/user/apps/your_app/private).
#
# When using Nginx and Mongrel or Apache and mod_rails/Passenger to serve a Kete instance, significant
# performance improvements can be made by using special proxy-specific headers to send privately
# stored files to the browser.
#
# These headers are X-Accel-Redirect for Nginx, and X-SENDFILE for Apache.
#
# In order to support these headers, the following steps must be made:
#
# 1.  Prepare your proxy server to use the appropriate send_file header.
#     (See specific instructions below.)
#
#     1.1   Nginx
#
#           a)  Open your Nginx configuration file or vhost file (normally nginx.conf) and add the
#               following declaration to your 'server' configuration blocks.
#
#               location /private/ {
#                 root /home/user/apps/kete/;   # Be sure to replace this with the actual location of
#                                               # your Kete instance. The trailing slash is imporant.
#                 internal;
#               }
#
#           b)  Restart your Nginx server. If it fails to restart, check your error logs/console for
#               any syntax errors in the configuration files.
#
#           NB: Without the declaration above, the X-Accel-Redirect header will not function correctly.
#
#     1.2   Apache
#
#           a)  See http://tn123.ath.cx/mod_xsendfile/ for mod_xsendfile installation and configuration.
#
#           NB: mod_xsendfile and Apache2's X-SendFile header are not current tested with this setting,
#               proceed with caution. Report any issues to
#               http://kete.lighthouseapp.com/projects/14288-kete.
#
# 2.  Change the Ruby constant below to one of the following settings:
#
#     * "" (empty string):  use Ruby on Rails's native send_file method, streaming the file directly
#                           from your web server (e.g. Mongrel cluster, etc). This works out-of-the-box.
#
#     * "nginx":            send Nginx's X-Accel-Redirect header instead of streaming the file, causing
#                           Nginx to send the file directly without using a mongrel instance to stream
#                           files. This requires Nginx to be configured correctly as per step 1.1 above
#                           to work successfully.
#
#     * "apache":           send Apache2 + mod_xsendfile's X-SENDFILE header instead of streaming the file,
#                           causing Apache2 to stream the file directly. This requires Apache2 and
#                           mod_xsendfile to be installed and configured correctly. This is currently
#                           untested.
#
# 3.  Restart your Kete instance. This will require either stopping and starting Mongrel clusters, or
#     restarting your Apache2 instance depending on your server environment.
#
# 4.  Test your Kete instance by uploading and downloading a private file. The log should display what
#     method is being used to send the file to the browser. (Streaming file.. is the default.)
#
# Notes:
#
# * As the Apache2 + mod_xsendfile method is untested, any feedback or further instructions are appreciated.
#   Please report any issues to http://kete.lighthouseapp.com/projects/14288-kete.
#
# * The safest option (and also the slowest) is to use Ruby on Rails's native send_file method. Set the ruby
#   constant below to an empty string (i.e. SENDFILE_METHOD = "") to use this.
#

# Select which send_file method to use to send private files to a browser from a Kete instance.
# Valid values are "", "nginx", or "apache".

SENDFILE_METHOD = ''

# (Do not edit below here.)

unless ['', 'apache', 'nginx'].member?(SENDFILE_METHOD)
  print "/!\\ WARNING: Incorrect value for SENDFILE_METHOD in config/initializers/send_file_options.rb on line 77. Should be one of \"\", \"apache\", or \"nginx\"; but was \"#{SENDFILE_METHOD}\". /!\\\n"
