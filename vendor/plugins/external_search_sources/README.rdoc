= External Search Sources

This Rails Engine provides an interface, helpers, and fixture data for pulling search results from external sources via RSS feeds.

External Search Sources was developed for the [Kete](http://kete.net.nz) open source Ruby on Rails application by [Katipo Communications, Ltd.](http://katipo.co.nz/) and was funded by [Digital New Zealand](http://digitalnz.org/).


== Requirements

* Rails 2.3 or higher - Prior versions will not work because of incomplete engine support or missing I18n support
* ActiveScaffold plugin installed for admin interface to work (http://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold)
* Kete version of the Feedzirra gem (http://github.com/kete/feedzirra)

== Assumptions (configurable, see Configuration section for details)

* Authorization plugin (http://github.com/DocSavage/rails-authorization-plugin)
* Acts as authenticated (http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/acts_as_authenticated)


== Installation

=== Step 1

Open a console, and in the root of you Rails application, install the plugin by running one of the following (depending on the method you use to import plugins):

* script/plugin install git://github.com/kete/external_search_sources.git
* piston import git://github.com/kete/external_search_sources.git vendor/plugins/external_search_sources
* git submodule add git://github.com/kete/external_search_sources.git vendor/plugins/external_search_sources
* Download the latest files ( http://github.com/kete/external_search_sources/tarball/master ) and extract to vendor/plugins/external_search_sources

=== Step 2

Install migrations and public images.

  rake external_search_sources:sync

=== Step 3

Update your database.

  rake db:migrate

=== Step 4

Where you want search sources displayed, add the following to the view file

  display_search_sources 'test'

Replace the string 'test' with a search term variable or other search term string you want search sources to return results of.

=== Step 5

Add some search sources. Go to /search_sources/list and add some data into the correct fields.

Alternatively, use some fixture data included with the plugin. You can do this in two ways:

* Importing search sources via import form on search sources controller

* Running a rake task - rake external_search_sources:import


== Configuration

=== Styling

Nesting of divs and results is as follows. You'll need firebug or examine the source manually if you need more than this.

Format: Element name followed by #[string] (id) and .[string] (classes). e.g.  div#some_div.class1.class2 = <div id="some_div" class="class1 class2">

  div#search_sources
    h3#search_sources_heading
    for each search source
      h4#[search_source_title_id]_heading
      div#[search_source_title_id]_links
        for each link result
          div#[search_source_title_id]_result_[result_object_id].ExternalSearchSources[:default_link_classes]
      div#[search_source_title_id]_images.images
        for each image result
          div#[search_source_title_id]_result_[result_object_id].ExternalSearchSources[:image_link_classes]
      div#[search_source_title_id]_more_results.ExternalSearchSources[:default_link_classes]

=== Settings

ExternalSearchSources has methods for [] (accessor) and []= (writer). The settings available can be found in

  lib/external_search_sources.rb

To override some settings, create an initializer, copy the config lines from lib/external_search_sources.rb to the initializer, and change to suit.

If you don't add settings to the initializer, the plugin will fall back to what is uses by default.

Once you've done the initial configuration to get things working, the one you'll most likely want to change is:

  :source_targets
    Allows you to limit search sources to various pages based on the target.
    For example, if you have a products search sources that you want on other product pages,
    and a blog posts search source that you want on the news page, you would create two targets,
    product and news, then adjust the options in the call to display_search_sources so that
    :target is set and pulls only the search sources you want.

=== Method Overrides

The plugin makes an assumption about other plugins you have installed and uses methods from them to get things working.

Most of the time though, you'll have a different setup.

There are two methods that you can override to suit your applications environment. They are:

  authorized_to_access_search_sources?
    This method returns a true or false depending on whether the current user is allowed access to the search sources admin interface.

  redirect_if_not_authorized
    This method calls the authorized_to_access_search_sources? method, and if it returns false, it will redirect to the unauthorized path (see ExternalSearchSources[:unauthorized_path]) with a flash message.

The last assumption is a login_required method exists that runs on a before_filter, which you can change to your own method by configuring ExternalSearchSources[:login_method]

Override any of the above methods by adding a similarly named method in application_controller.rb. If the call to super works, then it'll use it. Else if will fall back to what the plugin has by default.

=== Output

The display_search_sources helper method takes an options hash as a second parameter.

So far, the working options are:

  :target => [symbol] / [array of symbols]
    Matches search sources with same value
    More targets can be added to ExternalSearchSources[:source_targets]
    If no target is passed in, all search sources are displayed.
    Default(s) => :homepage or :search.

  :do_not_cache => [boolean]
    Overwrite caching on a per display basis.
    Set to true to disable caching for the output.
    When false, falls back to ExternalSearchSources[:cache_results]
    Default(s) => false

  :limit => [integer]
    Overwrite the search sources default limit.
    Useful for cases where the number per page changes dynamically.
    When nil, falls back to search source default
    Default(s) => nil

  :title => [string]
    The title of the search sources box.
    Default(s) => 'Other Resources'

=== Internationalization (I18n)

This engine uses the I18n features of Rails 2.2 and later to allow for easily translation of the search source interface, and output.

Locales are stored in config/locales  inside the engine directory. When locales are completed, they are added to an array in init.rb that adds each to the I18n load path.

To use your own strings, open up the locale of your choice in an editor of your choice and change them to suit.

Alternatively, overwrite values from your applications locale file.

We accept new locales for the engine. If you willing and able to help, please feel free to fork the engine on Github, make your changes, and send a pull request.


== Testing

The plugin comes with a test suite that can be run once the plugin is installed in an application.

Change into the plugins directory and run 'rake' to start them.

Note: The tests are run on Rails 2.3 because it is the only version with engine support (see requirements section)


== Reporting an Issue

If you have a problem, please report it on the external_search_sources plugin ticket tracker (on Ligthouseapp)

http://kete.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32521-external_search_sources/tickets

Be sure to include Rails version, plugin version, and when possible, a sample application that can reproduce the problem.

Upload it to one of the various file hosting sites and link to it in the ticket.

Don't include vendored rails or the external_search_sources plugin in the archive (if I know the versions, I'll add these myself).


== Contributing

If you've added something, why not share it.

Fork the repository (http://github.com/kete/external_search_sources), make the changes and send a pull request to the maintainers.

Changes with tests, and full documentation are preferred, but not required.
