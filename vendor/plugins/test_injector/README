== Tests performed

The automatically injected tests are currently limited to tests against ActiveRecord models.  However, there
is nothing stopping you from adding tests for other portions of the framework.

== ActiveRecord tests

Every association defined in the ActiveRecord model. A common model might look like:

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
		has_and_belongs_to_many :groups
		belongs_to :company
		has_many :purchases, :class_name => "Order", :dependent => :nullify
		has_many :subscriptions, :dependent => :destroy
		has_many :newspapers, :through => subscriptions
	end
	
	By calling inject_activerecord_tests in the class definition, several test will be injected into 
	the test suite at runtime.
	
	class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
		fixtures :groups, :companies, :orders, :subscriptions, :newspapers
		inject_tests :activerecord
	end	
	
	Based on the example User class, the following tests will be run (notice that we didn't have to define any test
	methods in the test class):
	
	def test_has_and_belongs_to_many_groups
		# asserts that groups is an Array of Groups
	end

	def test_belongs_to_company
		# asserts that company return an instance of Company
	end
	
	def test_has_many_purchases
		# asserts that purchases is an Array of Purchases
		# asserts that associated purchases's user_id column is nullified when the user is deleted
	end
	
	def test_has_many_subscriptions
		# asserts that subscriptions is an array of Subscriptions
		# asserts that all subscriptions are destroyed when a User is deleted
	end
	
	def test_has_many_newspapers_through_subscriptions
		# asserts that newspapers is an array of Newspapers
	end
	
	def test_fixture_defined_for_companies
		# tests to see if a fixture called 'companies' is defined in the unit test
	end
	
	def test_fixture_defined_for_purchases
	  # tests to see if a fixture called 'orders' is defined in the unit test
	end
	
	def test_fixture_defined_for_subscriptions
	  # tests to see if a fixture called 'subscriptions' is defined in the unit test
	end
	
	def test_fixture_defined_for_newspapers
		# tests to see if a fixture called 'newspapers' is defined in the unit test
	end
	
	# if the users table has a 'lock_version' column, one test will be defined
	def test_optimistic_locking
		# forces a StaleObjectError in order to test that optimisic locking is functioning correctly
	end
	
	# if the users table is using the acts_as_versioned plugin by technoweenie, one test will be defined
	def test_acts_as_versioned
		# tests that the versioned table is set up correctly by exercising the versioning system
	end
	
=== Ignoring associations

	You can specify associations that should not be tested when by using the :ignore_associations option:
	
	inject_tests :activerecord, :ignore_associations => [:company, :groups]

=== Overriding injected tests

	As long as you use place the inject_tests declaration at the top of the test class, you can override
	any of the injected tests by redeclaring a method with the same name.  See above for the test method
	naming.
	
== To do

* Better tests on polymorphic associations
* Test standard validations
