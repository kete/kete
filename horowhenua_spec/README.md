# Horowhenua specs (You can probably ignore these)

These legacy specs depend on a canonical fixture dataset from Horowhenua. They
were used as a stop-gap during the rails 2->3 upgrade process.

The sample data is only available to Rabid Technologies so these specs are not generally useful.

To run these specs:

1. Ensure you have sample data loaded into `kete_horowhenua`
1. `bundle exec rspec --default-path=./horowhenua_spec`
